# 0x09. Web infrastructure design

## Project Description

Our project aims to provide comprehensive learning on key topics within the sysadmin/devops track, covering fundamental concepts and practical tasks. Participants will delve into building and understanding a web stack, particularly focusing on the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) architecture. Through hands-on tasks, they will learn to set up each component of the stack, configure them for optimal performance, and deploy a web application.

Central to the project is the creation of a detailed diagram illustrating the entire web stack, showcasing the roles and interactions of each component. Participants will gain a deep understanding of what each element does within the system, from the web server (Apache or Nginx) handling incoming requests to the application server (PHP) executing dynamic code and the database (MySQL) managing data storage and retrieval.

Moreover, the project will delve into the critical concept of system redundancy, addressing the challenges posed by a Single Point of Failure (SPOF) and the importance of redundancy in ensuring system reliability and availability. Participants will explore strategies for redundancy implementation across different layers of the web stack, enhancing fault tolerance and minimizing downtime.

Throughout the project, participants will also become familiar with essential acronyms such as SPOF (Single Point of Failure) and QPS (Queries Per Second), enabling them to effectively communicate and understand key concepts within the realm of sysadmin and devops. By the project's conclusion, participants will have gained invaluable knowledge and practical skills essential for designing, deploying, and maintaining robust web infrastructures.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
- You must be able to explain what each component is doing
- You must be able to explain system redundancy
Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Requirements

### General

- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
- This project will be manually reviewed:
- As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
- Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
- For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
- After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
- You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
- Focus on what you are being asked:
- Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
- Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
- Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
- In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked.
